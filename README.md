# ITCS 3160 - Final Project
This is the full three parts of my final project for ITCS 3160 - Database Design and Implementation

The project is split into three parts:
* Part 1: (E)ER Design
* Part 2: Relational Mapping, Creating Database Schema, and Populating Database
* Part3: Complete Database and Final Report

## Overview
* Part 1 includes the design (included in the report and as a separate png file
* Part 2 includes the implementation of the basic database schema and data insertion
* Part 3 includes views, triggers, queries, and final report linked as a docx file

### Skills Learned
During this first part, I worked on the following skills:
* Plan ways to map relationships and entities based on client requirements
* Brainstorm solutions to difficult relations and workarounds for conflicts in design
* Use specialization to branch out into parent and child relationships
* Designate all required attributes to the corresponding entities in a visually fitting manner
* Quickly and efficiently space out parts of design in a visually pleasant and informative layout
Part 2 required me to really apply my SQL knowledge, and here is what I learned:
* Defining large sets of data tables, specifically those that might depend on each other
* Inserting large amounts of data and making sure everything lines up
* Switching between scripts that have different functions in SQL and generalizing the work flow
* Using queries as data is added to check that insertions were completed and proper
* Using a conceptual plan to implement a physical database
Part 3 pushed me to understand the database as a whole, so the following skills improved:
* Setting triggers to keep information insertion and update in line with requirements
* Creating views to make sure information is readily availible or hidden if needed
* Querying for specific data inside any table that may be complex or linked to other tables
